## Introduction 

I decided to do this project because I wanted to visualize the warning signs of a recession using data analytics. Since the price of gold is often correlated with economic and political uncertainty, I decided to make a simple algorithm to trade gold as well. Please see GoldAnalysis first as it justifies what is used in the algorithm.

For anyone interested in creating an algorithm similar to this, I will have directions for installing the required software to do so at a later date. 


## To Do
* Implement more macroeconomic indicators
* More data for the price of gold-- Currently the algorithm is trading a gold ETF(SPDR Gold Shares) since it was the only free data I could find in the correct OHLCV format. This data only goes back to 2004
* optimization method-- Performance is not optimized, right now the weights of indicators are based on trial and error
