# <p align='justify'>The Price of Gold VS Indicators of a Recession</p>

<p align='justify'>Cole Sussmeier</p>


## Introduction 

I decided to do this project because I wanted to visualize the warning signs of a recession using data analytics. Since the price of gold is often correlated with economic and political uncertainty, I decided to make a simple algorithm to trade gold as well. Please see GoldAnalysis first as it justifies what is used in the algorithm.

## December 2019 Update

The data used for this project has not been updated for 2019. The yield curve has since gone negative and the media is beginning to talk about the possibility of a recession. The results of this project indicated that changes in the federal funds rate are correlated with the price of gold. However, this is only a demonstration of an idea and should not be used as a basis to make financial decisions. 


## To Do
* Implement more macroeconomic indicators
* More data for the price of gold-- Currently the algorithm is trading a gold ETF(SPDR Gold Shares) since it was the only free data I could find in the correct OHLCV format. This data only goes back to 2004
* Optimization method-- Performance is not optimized, right now the weights of indicators are based on trial and error
